# OCR--PYTESSERACT
## PDF Scan Data Extraction

This project focuses on extracting data from scanned PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. Leveraging Python libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) and pytesseract, we've developed a robust solution to extract text content from scanned PDF files and convert it into structured JSON format.

### Key Features:
OCR Data Extraction: Utilizing pytesseract, we've implemented OCR functionality to extract text data from scanned PDF documents, overcoming the challenge of working with non-searchable PDFs.

###Image Preprocessing: 
Employing PIL (Python Imaging Library), we've incorporated image preprocessing techniques to enhance the accuracy of text extraction, including noise reduction, contrast adjustment, and image binarization.

### JSON Output: 
The extracted text content is organized and stored in JSON format, providing a structured representation of the data for further analysis and processing.

## Repository Contents:
### PDF Data Extraction Scripts: Python scripts for processing scanned PDF files and extracting text data using OCR techniques.
### Image Preprocessing Functions: Modules containing image preprocessing functions to optimize text extraction accuracy.
